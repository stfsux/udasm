udasm
-----

Tiny disassembler  for microcontrollers  with configurable  memory map.  Most of
existing disassemblers for microcontrollers are either a part of binutils or IDA
processor modules  with a static  memory map. In  other words, you  usually have
either  to recompile  the  processor module  or use  a  third-party script  that
handles internal registers. Thanks to libconfig,  with udasm you can easly write
your own memory map with a single configuration file and without recompiling the
whole shit.
